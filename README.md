Automatically userstamps create and update operations if the table has columns named **created_by** and/or **updated_by**.
The Blamer gem attempts to mirror the simplicity of ActiveRecord's timestamp module.

Blamer expects `User.current_user` to return the current user object. Basic setup involves assigning to `User.current_user` in a controller before filter:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      cattr_accessor :current_user
    end

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      before_action :set_userstamp

      def set_userstamp
        User.current_user = User.find(session[:user_id])
      end
    end

If you don't want to use `User.current_user` you can override this behavior by writing your own `userstamp_object` method in ActiveRecord::Base or any of your models. For example, to use `Person.current` instead:

    def userstamp_object
      Person.current
    end

A default/fallback userstamp_object can be set if you never want to set the userstamps to nil be defining a `default_userstamp_object` method in your model:

    def default_userstamp_object
      Person.find_by(name: 'Admin')
    end

If you don't like created_by/updated_by you can customize the column names:

    # Globally in environment.rb
    ActiveRecord::Base.created_userstamp_column = :creator_id
    ActiveRecord::Base.updated_userstamp_column = :updator_id

    # In a model definition
    class Subscription
      self.created_userstamp_column = :creator_id
      self.updated_userstamp_column = :updater_id
    end

Automatic userstamping can be turned off globally by setting:

    ActiveRecord::Base.record_userstamps = false

Blamer adds a `userstamps` migration helper which will add the created_by and updated_by columns (or your custom column names) to your table:

    create_table :widgets do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
      t.userstamps
    end

## Thread Safety

If you need thread safety make sure that your implementation of `User.current_user` (or your custom user object) is thread safe.  Here's one way this can be accomplished:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.current_user
        Thread.current[:current_user]
      end

      def self.current_user=(user)
        Thread.current[:current_user] = user
      end
    end

## Compatability

Blamer is tested to be compatible with Rails 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x. See version specific Installation
instructions below.

## Installation

You must use the correct version of blamer for the version of Rails you are running:

### Rails 5+

Add to your Gemfile

    gem 'blamer'

Or

    gem 'blamer', github: 'infused/blamer'
